# <h2>Description</h2>

The Project Car Tracker API is designed to manage todo lists for project cars, allowing users to track different tasks and updates related to their car restoration or modification projects. This application allows users to create, read, update, and delete information about project cars and associated tasks, such as engine rebuilds, interior and exterior improvements, and suspension upgrades.<br>
