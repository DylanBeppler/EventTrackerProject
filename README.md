# <h2>Description</h2>

The Project Car Tracker API is designed to manage todo lists for project cars, allowing users to track different tasks and updates related to their car restoration or modification projects. This application allows users to create, read, update, and delete information about project cars and associated tasks, such as engine rebuilds, interior and exterior improvements, and suspension upgrades.<br>

# <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

<h4>Throughout the development of the Project Car Tracker, I learned a few things including:</h4>

<strong>REST API Design:</strong> Principles of RESTful design and how to create intuitive and scalable API endpoints.<br><br>
<strong>CRUD Operations:</strong> Implementing the basic Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations in a REST API to manage resources.<br><br>
<strong>Testing with Postman:</strong> Leveraging Postman for testing API routes, validating request and response formats, and ensuring correct status codes are returned.<br>

<strong>Asynchronous Processing in JavaScript:</strong> Learned to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript using XMLHttpRequest to make non-blocking calls to the server, ensuring a responsive user interface.<br><br>
<strong>DOM Manipulation:</strong> Enhanced my skills in dynamically updating the HTML document with JavaScript, creating a seamless and interactive user experience without page reloads.<br><br>
